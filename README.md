# Data-Cleaning-Course-Project(Peer Graded Assignment)

My name is Avantika Deb and this repository contains my submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It demonstrates the following steps on how to run analysis on Human Activity Recognition dataset.

The data used for the analysis is "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables included in the dataset, the data itself, and the transformations or steps performed to clean the data.

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps as described in the course project:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
